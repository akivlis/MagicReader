This is my pet project for realtime scanning of MTG cards.

I have used https://api.scryfall.com API for fetching data for the cards. For card detection I am using `Vision` framework. 

The detection is still not perfect, ut this is still my work in progress and I like to work on it and improve in my free time. Feel free to contribute and help me with the card detection regardless of if you are a MTG fan or not :)
